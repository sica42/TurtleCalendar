# TurtleCalendar
**Version:** 0.2
**Game Version:** Turtle WoW (Interface 11200)

Shows you an in-game calendar with all relevant timers:
* Raid lockouts
* Battleground of the day
* Darkmoon Faire location
* Instances lockout timers

Use `/turtlecalendar` or `/tc` to toggle calendar, or assign a hotkey in key bindings.

Right click the calendar to toggle the visibility of the different timers. You toggle dates on in the right click menu.

If you are grouped and group leader does a "Reset all instances" you will have to manually reset the current instance timer. You can do this with `/tc reset`.
If the group leader have TurtleCalendar installed you do not need to do this.
