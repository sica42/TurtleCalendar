# TurtleCalendar
**Version:** 0.2
**Game Version:** Turtle WoW (Interface 11200)

Shows you an in-game calendar with all relevant timers:
* Raid lockouts
* Battleground of the day
* Darkmoon Faire location
* Instances lockout timers

Use `/turtlecalendar` or `/tc` to toggle calendar, or assign a hotkey in key bindings.

If you are grouped and group leader does a "Reset all instances" you will have to manually reset the current instance timer. You can do this with `/tc reset`.
If the group leader have TurtleCalendar installed you do not need to do this.
